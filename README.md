# Chaucer-Srabble
This is a digital humanities project that functions as a modified version of the Scrabble Game 
in which the user can only use words from Chaucer's famous work "The Wife of Bath's Tale."

In addition to the typical interface, this implementation also has an audial feature:
Every early middle english word that is submitted is read out loud. Additionally, several
of the instructions are also read out loud.
